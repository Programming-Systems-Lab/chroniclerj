ChroniclerJ [Chronicler implemented in Java]
=======

*Lightweight Recording of Nondeterministic Inputs to Reproduce Field Failures*

**ChroniclerJ** is a system for recording buggy program executions in the field and reproducing them in the lab. **ChroniclerJ** is our Java implementation of **Chronicler**, a generalized record and replay approach for VM-based languages.

This repository contains the source and a [runnable binary](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/chroniclerj/blob/master/chroniclerj-0.4.1.jar) for **ChroniclerJ**.

Running
-----
### Instrumenting your code
Before deploying your code, you need to run the **ChroniclerJ** instrumenter, which will produce two copies of your program: one for deployment (with logging code), and one for replay purposes (with code that reads back from the log).

To run the instrumenter, use the command `java -jar chroniclerj-0.4.1.jar -instrument {-mxLogN} input ouputLocationDeploy outputLocationReplay`, where:
* `{-mxLogN}` is an optional parameter indiciating that at most `N` items should be stored in the in-memory logfile before it is flushed to disk
* `input` is the path that contains the .class files, .jar files, etc that need to be instrumented (e.g. what you would be deploying normally)
* `outputLocationDeploy` is where you would like the generated code (for deployment) to be placed
* `outputLocationReplay` is where you would like the generated code (for running replays) to be placed

It is important that *all* libraries that you plan to deploy with your application are instrumented. We suggest running the instrumenter at the top level folder that you were going to deploy, which might contain several jar files, several class files, etc.

### Collecting test cases
Deploy your code as you normally would, but deploy the code that was instrumented and placed in `outputLocationDeploy` rather than your original, uninstrumented code. Make sure that the **ChroniclerJ** jar is in your classpath too.

When an uncaught exception ocurrs, **ChroniclerJ** generates a test case. You can manually invoke this process (e.g. from your own exception handler) by calling the method `ChroniclerJExceptionRunner.genTestCase()`. Users are notified that a test case was generated, which is placed in the current working directory and has the name format chroniclerj-crash-*currenttime*.test. The test case file contains all logs necessary to replay the execution.

### Replaying test cases
To replay the failed executions, run the command `java -jar chroniclerj-0.4.1.jar -replay testCase {classpath}`, where
* `testCase` is the test case to run
* `{classpath}` is a space-delimited classpath passed to your program when it starts to replay

Building
-----
**ChroniclerJ** is an eclipse project, and should simply be added to eclipse, and built as a Java project.

###Packaging
To create the **ChroniclerJ** jar, first run the `unpackLibs.sh` command to unpack the libraries that **ChroniclerJ** depends on, then `makeJar.sh` to generate a jar file with **ChroniclerJ** and its libraries embedded.
